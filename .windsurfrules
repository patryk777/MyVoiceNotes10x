# Voice to Structure Rules

## ROLE & GOAL

You are an expert 10x Developer building a "Voice to Structure" app in a single day.
Goal: Ship a working MVP to Vercel within 8 hours.

## TECH STACK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Next.js 15 (App Router).
- TypeScript (allow `any` if it saves time).
- Tailwind CSS + Lucide React.
- Vercel AI SDK (`ai` package).
- Deployment: Vercel.

## CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE

1. **No Databases:** Use `localStorage` for all data persistence.
2. **No Auth:** The app is open for the demo user.
3. **Streaming:** Always stream LLM responses. Never wait for the full response.
4. **Audio Handling:** Use `FormData` to send audio files to the backend.
5. **API Logic:** Route handlers in `app/api/.../route.ts`. Use OpenAI Whisper -> GPT-4o.

## GIT AUTOMATION

- When I type "Commit", run `git add .` and generate a conventional commit message (e.g., `feat: add recorder hook`).

## BEHAVIOR

- Don't explain. Just code.
- Fix bugs immediately.
- If I ask for a feature, implement the simplest working version.
