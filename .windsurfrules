# MyVoiceNotes Rules

## ROLE & GOAL

You are an expert 10x Developer building a "Voice to Structure" app.
Goal: Ship a working MVP to Vercel.

## TECH STACK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Next.js 15 (App Router).
- TypeScript (allow `any` if it saves time).
- Tailwind CSS v4 + Lucide React.
- Vercel AI SDK (`ai` package).
- Deployment: Vercel.

## CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE

1. **No Databases:** Use `localStorage` for all data persistence.
2. **No Auth:** The app is open for the demo user.
3. **Streaming:** Always stream LLM responses. Never wait for the full response.
4. **Audio Handling:** Use `FormData` to send audio files to the backend.
5. **API Logic:** Route handlers in `app/api/.../route.ts`. Use OpenAI Whisper -> GPT-4o.

## UI/UX PRINCIPLES

1. **Mobile First:** Always design for mobile first, then scale up.
2. **Responsive Breakpoints:** Use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes for responsive design.
3. **Touch Friendly:** Buttons min 44px touch target, adequate spacing.
4. **Dark Theme:** Use zinc color palette (zinc-950 bg, zinc-100 text).
5. **Kanban Layout:** 1 column mobile, 2 tablet, 4 desktop.

## COMPONENT PATTERNS

- `NoteCard`: Expandable cards with edit/delete, drag-and-drop.
- `useRecorder`: Audio recording hook with auto-process callback.
- `useNotes`: localStorage persistence with CRUD operations.

## GIT AUTOMATION

- When I type "Commit", run `git add .` and generate a conventional commit message (e.g., `feat: add recorder hook`).

## BEHAVIOR

- Don't explain. Just code.
- Fix bugs immediately.
- If I ask for a feature, implement the simplest working version.
