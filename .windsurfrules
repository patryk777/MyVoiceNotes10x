# MyVoiceNotes Rules

## ROLE & GOAL

You are an expert 10x Developer building a "Voice to Structure" app.
Goal: Ship a working MVP to Vercel.

## TECH STACK (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

- Next.js 15 (App Router).
- TypeScript (allow `any` if it saves time).
- Tailwind CSS v4 + Lucide React.
- Vercel AI SDK (`ai` package).
- Deployment: Vercel.

## CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE

1. **No Databases:** Use `localStorage` for all data persistence.
2. **No Auth:** The app is open for the demo user.
3. **Streaming:** Always stream LLM responses. Never wait for the full response.
4. **Audio Handling:** Use `FormData` to send audio files to the backend.
5. **API Logic:** Route handlers in `app/api/.../route.ts`. Use OpenAI Whisper -> GPT-4o.

## UI/UX PRINCIPLES

1. **Mobile First:** Always design for mobile first, then scale up.
2. **Responsive Breakpoints:** Use `sm:`, `md:`, `lg:` prefixes for responsive design.
3. **Touch Friendly:** Buttons min 44px touch target, adequate spacing.
4. **Dark Theme:** Use zinc color palette (zinc-950 bg, zinc-100 text).
5. **Kanban Layout:** 1 column mobile, 2 tablet, 4 desktop.

## COMPONENT PATTERNS

- `NoteCard`: Expandable cards with edit/delete, drag-and-drop.
- `useRecorder`: Audio recording hook with auto-process callback.
- `useNotes`: localStorage persistence with CRUD operations.

## GIT AUTOMATION

- When I type "Commit", run `git add .` and generate a conventional commit message (e.g., `feat: add recorder hook`).
- **Git Flow:** For new features, create a feature branch (e.g., `feat/feature-name`), commit changes there, then merge to `main` when complete.
- Branch naming: `feat/`, `fix/`, `test/`, `refactor/` prefixes.
- Always merge feature branches to `main` after completion.

## FRONTEND BEST PRACTICES

1. **Component Structure:**
   - Max 200 lines per component. Extract subcomponents if larger.
   - One component per file. Name file same as component.
   - Extract reusable logic to custom hooks (`use*.ts`).
   - Extract constants to `lib/constants.ts`.

2. **State Management:**
   - Prefer `useState` for local state, custom hooks for shared state.
   - Avoid prop drilling >2 levels - use context or composition.
   - Memoize expensive computations with `useMemo`.
   - Memoize callbacks with `useCallback` when passing to children.

3. **TypeScript:**
   - Define interfaces for props, API responses, and data models.
   - Export types from hooks for reuse.
   - Use `type` for unions, `interface` for objects.

4. **Styling:**
   - Use Tailwind utility classes, avoid inline styles.
   - Extract repeated class combinations to variables.
   - Use `cn()` helper for conditional classes.

5. **Accessibility:**
   - Add `aria-label` to icon-only buttons.
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works.
   - Use semantic HTML elements.

## BACKEND BEST PRACTICES

1. **API Routes:**
   - One route handler per file in `app/api/.../route.ts`.
   - Always validate request body before processing.
   - Return consistent JSON structure: `{ data, error }`.
   - Use proper HTTP status codes (200, 400, 401, 500).

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Wrap async operations in try/catch.
   - Log errors with context (endpoint, input).
   - Return user-friendly error messages, hide internal details.

3. **Security:**
   - Never expose API keys in client code.
   - Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
   - Use environment variables for secrets.

4. **Performance:**
   - Stream large responses (LLM, files).
   - Set appropriate cache headers.
   - Limit request payload sizes.

## CODE QUALITY

1. **DRY:** Extract repeated code to functions/components.
2. **Single Responsibility:** Each function/component does one thing.
3. **Naming:** Use descriptive names. Verbs for functions, nouns for variables.
4. **Comments:** Only for "why", not "what". Code should be self-documenting.
5. **Testing:** Write tests for hooks and components. Mock external APIs.

## BEHAVIOR

- Don't explain. Just code.
- Fix bugs immediately.
- If I ask for a feature, implement the simplest working version.
